# Level Design Document

*NOTE: the levels of the game are tightly coupled with the course curriculum*

Each level consists of several challanges with specific objectives. A challange is a grid based puzzle/maze layout and the player controls a spacecraft to move inside the maze to complete the objectives in the most efficient way. Points are being earned based on the number of instructions (or blocks) used to complete all objectives. Comppleting the objectives in a given challange unlocks the next one. There might be bonus objectives in a challange.Completing all challanges ends the level. 

## Level 1: Sequenced Execution
In this level the user is introduced to the concept of sequenced execution of instructions in the computer. This is the first time he uses programming blocks  to control the player ship. The basic ship functionalities are unlocked and no specific programming constructs are used. The main goal is for the user to get gamiliar with the interface, to place the first programming blocks and to solve easy puzzles.

Example objectives:
* Destroy N asteroids
* Reach a target destination
* Don't crash the ship
