# unity-blockly-game
This is a R&D project, aimed at exploring the possibilities for communication between the browser's JS and a Unity game built for WebGL and embedded in the HTML document.
The goal is to be able to control the game at runtime via code, generated by the Google Blockly visual programming language.

NOTE: The project is in early development and is not intended to be cloned and tested outside it's dev environment.
